Ex 3.1.1 Show that Definition 3.1.4 is reflexive, symmetric, transitive.      

For sets A and B, A = B <=> For all x (x is element of A <=> x is element of B)       

Reflexivity:        
Since x is element of A <=> x is element of A, A = A.       

Symmetric:        
Since x is element of B <=> x is element of A, B = A.       

Transitive:       
Consider 3 sets A, B, C. x is element of A <=> x is element of B <=> x is
element of C.       

QED.        

Ex 3.1.2 Prove that empty, {empty}, {{empty}}, {empty, {empty}} are distinct.
