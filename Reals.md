Prove that formal limits are well defined.        

x = x:
For all n >= 1, we have |an - an| = 0 < epsilon.                  

x = y => y = x:
For all n >= N, we have |an - bn| < epsilon. But |an - bn| = |bn - an|.             

x = y and y = z => x = z:         
For all n >= N1, we have |an - bn| < epsilon/2. For all m >= N2, we have          
|bn - cn| < epsilon/2. Then |an - cn| = |an - bn + bn -cn| <= |an - bn| +             
|bn - cn| < epsilon.          

QED.
